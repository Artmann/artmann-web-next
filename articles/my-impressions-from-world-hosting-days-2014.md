## Open source is great

The value of open source development has reached even greater spread and
hopefully this will lead to additional exchange of knowledge.

## Love your ecosystems

Having a community around your product and then most importantly, have a product
which allows your community to extend and modify it for their own personal
needs.

## Big data will get even bigger

Big data has been the thing to talk about for a while now and it’s still growing
and recent analysis shows that by 2020 the amount of storage needed will be
around 40 exabytes, that would equal about 85 million years of HD video. Seagate
presented that they needed to innovate and move away from their classical disk
manufacturing and the current way of building SANs. When they presented their
new Kinetic disks they showed that they really have started to innovate and are
building disks for object storage that can communicate over Ethernet.

## Detach your resources

We have been moving our storage out from our servers for quit a while now and
Intel presented that they want to do the same with the rest of our system
resources. Using fiber optics they want to move memory and CPU out of the
servers and into a rack level.

## Arm enters the data center

AMD was present to talk about their new investment into Arm processor wanting to
create CPUs for specific tasks like video rendering and data analytics.

## Microsoft impresses

With their new concept, Cloud OS which is based on Windows server and Azure pack
among others and lets you build and move between public and private clouds and
alot of other cool features.

## Learn to love your orchestration layer

While automated deployment and provisioning continue to grow and PaaS and SaaS
are getting more popular the demand for on-demand infrastructure will increase.

## Focus on the things you are good at and do them better

Identify the parts of your business that you do the best, focus on these and
partner up with top actors in your edge areas.
